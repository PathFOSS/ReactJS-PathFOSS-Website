# PathFOSS Official Website
This repository contains all the JSX, HTML, CSS, SVG, PNG, and MP4 files for a one-page website of the PathFOSS portfolio.


## What is the purpose of the website?
To explain the purpose behind projects and to host explanatory videos of them, as well as show contact information and principles behind all the work.


## How was the website made?
With VSCodium, React.js, Vite, and npm. 

Six CSS files were created for responsive behavior.

Unit tests are primarily run on Vitest.

## How were the videos made?
With the help of stock videos from https://www.pexels.com and screenrecordings from Android devices and browser screens. These were rendered in Kdenlive and further compressed with FFMPEG with libx264 encoding to meet GitHub user upload requirements (under 10MB videos).
