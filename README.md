# PathFOSS Official Website
This repository contains all the JSX, HTML, CSS, SVG, PNG, and MP4 files for a one-page website of the PathFOSS portfolio.


## What is the purpose of the website?
To explain the purpose behind projects and to host explanatory videos of them.


## How was the website made?
With ReactJS, Vite, and npm. Six CSS files were created for responsive behavior. 

## How were the videos made?
With the help of stock videos from https://www.pexels.com and screenrecordings from an Android device. These were rendered in Kdenlive and further compressed with FFMPEG with libx264 encoding to meet GitHub user upload requirements (under 10MB videos).
